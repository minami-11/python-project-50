### Description:
Here is the Gendiff programm. It compares two files and marks differences between them
(flat or nested - doesn't matter). This revision works only with json and yaml formats.
Has three output formats (default one - is stylish):
- stylish: nested output (tree view) with changing marks
- plain: if there is a difference if will be shown in a line
- json: raw output file with changing marks

#### How to use:
* enter outout format ('stylish' - is the default)
* and two file names (json or yaml)
* ..
* profit

#### Installation process and commands:

make package-install	#pip install Gendiff from .whl file
```
No errors occured - the installation has been success.

```
make package-uninstall  #pip uninstall the Gendiff
```

```
make lint		        #check quality of Python Code with flake8
make shell		        #enter virtual env
make publish		    #perform all actions for publishing, except uploading the package
make automate_build	    #start commans 1by1: shell, lint, build, publish, pip list
make check              #runs pytest and shows which tests have been run
make test-cover         #runs pytest cover and saves report in xml
gendiff1                #runs gendiff with file1.json and file2.json from main root dir
